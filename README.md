# Processing Sketches Collection

A collection of generative art sketches created with Processing (Java mode).

## How to Run

1.  **Download Processing**: Ensure you have the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download) (version 4 or newer recommended).
2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY.git
    ```
    (Replace `https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY.git` with the actual URL of this repository)
3.  **Open a Sketch**: In the Processing IDE, go to `File > Open...` and navigate to one of the sketch folders (e.g., `sketch_250430a`) inside the cloned repository. Select the `.pde` file within that folder.
4.  **Run the Sketch**: Click the "Run" button (play icon) in the Processing IDE.

| `sketch_250430g` | Recursively draws a branching fractal tree.                                                        | None                         |
| `sketch_250430h` | Shows a swarm of particles leaving noisy trails.                                                   | None                         |
| `sketch_250430i` | Rotating Squares: A grid of randomly colored squares that rotate based on mouse interaction.       | None                         |
| `sketch_250430j` | Particle System: Particles attracted to the mouse, leaving trails and changing color with speed.   | None                         |
| `sketch_250430k` | Fractal Tree: A recursively drawn tree whose branching is influenced by the mouse.                 | None                         |
| `sketch_250430l` | Perlin Noise Flow Field: An animated field of lines guided by Perlin noise.                        | None                         |
| `sketch_250430m` | Lissajous Curves: Animated Lissajous figures with evolving parameters and colors.                  | None                         |
| `sketch_250430n` | Generative typographic art using the Geomerative library to animate letterforms.                 | Geomerative                  |
| `sketch_250430o` | Interactive fluid simulation using the PixelFlow library, allowing mouse interaction to affect the fluid. | PixelFlow                    |

*Note: Most sketches run on standard Processing (Java mode) without needing external libraries beyond the core Processing package. Sketches requiring specific external libraries (like Geomerative or PixelFlow) are indicated in the table above. These libraries should be installed in your Processing sketchbook's `libraries` folder.*
