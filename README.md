# processing-sketches

This repository contains various sketches written in [Processing (Java mode)](https://processing.org/).

## ðŸ”§ How to run

1. Download this repository or clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krminfinity/processing-sketches.git
   ```
2. Open any of the sketch folders (e.g. `sketch_250430a`) with the Processing IDE.
3. Run the sketch to see the animated shapes.


## ðŸ§© Dependencies

All examples run on standard **Processing (Java mode)** without extra libraries.
You only need the core Processing package (version 4 or newer). If you wish to
use the command line tool, download `processing-java` from the official site.

## ðŸ“š Included sketches

- **sketch_250430a** â€“ Demonstrates nested transformations using `pushMatrix()` and `popMatrix()` with a rotating red square, a counterâ€‘rotating blue square, and a pulsating green circle.
- **sketch_250430b** â€“ Shows multiple independent objects (two squares and a spinning triangle) drawn with proper matrix isolation.
- **sketch_250430c** â€“ Creates a colorful generative pattern of circles that shift using Perlin noise.
- **sketch_250430d** â€“ Generates a dark swirling vortex of lines, using noise to create chaotic, apocalyptic motion.
- **sketch_250430e** â€“ Displays a colorful grid of rotating squares driven by 3D noise for an abstract digital pattern.
- **sketch_250430f** â€“ Renders a vibrant spiral of moving points that shift using Perlin noise.
